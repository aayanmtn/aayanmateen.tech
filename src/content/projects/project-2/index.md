# Necter Server Setup and MERN App DeploymentðŸš€

I recently had the opportunity to build a server for a company named Necter. My role involved setting up the Node.js server and configuring Nginx as a forward proxy. Additionally, I deployed a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) application on the server. Here's a brief overview of the process:

## Node.js Server Setup 

I installed and configured the Node.js server to host the company's web applications and APIs. This involved setting up routes, handling requests, and managing dependencies using npm.

## Nginx Configuration

Nginx was configured as a forward proxy to handle incoming requests and forward them to the Node.js server. This setup helped improve performance and security by offloading some of the processing tasks to Nginx.

## MERN App Deployment

I deployed a MERN application on the server, which included:

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used by the application to store data.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js used to build the backend API.
- **React.js**: A frontend library used to build the user interface of the application.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime used to run the backend server.

The MERN application provided a modern and efficient platform for Necter's web applications.

Overall, the project was successful, and the server setup, along with the deployment of the MERN application, provided a reliable and efficient platform for Necter's web applications.
