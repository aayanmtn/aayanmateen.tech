During my internship at AlNafi, I built a strong foundation in both cybersecurity and system operations. I had the opportunity to dive deep into the world of IT GRC, SIEM, SOC operations, VAPT, Web Security Testing (WSTG), and industrial security standards like OT/SCADA systems. My learning also covered key frameworks such as NIST, ISO 27000, ISO 62443, PCI-DSS, along with threat modeling concepts like the Cyber Kill Chain and MITRE ATT&CK.

I developed hands-on skills in RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux), automation with Ansible, and monitoring with Zabbix. I also gained practical experience deploying and managing web servers like Apache, NGINX, and Tomcat.

This internship was pivotal in shaping my understanding of both **SysOps** and **SecOps** â€” especially in how infrastructure, automation, and security intersect. I also started working with **AWS** cloud services, applying what I learned in real-world lab environments to understand IAM, EC2, S3, and cloud security principles.

Alongside the technical exposure, I practiced scripting with **Python** and **Bash**, using them for automation, incident handling, and reporting. This experience solidified my path into DevOps and SecurityOps, and it continues to influence how I design and implement secure, scalable infrastructure today.
