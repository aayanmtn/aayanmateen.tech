As an independent DevOps & SysOps Consultant, Iâ€™ve been working with startups, solo developers, and growing businesses to architect, automate, and optimize their infrastructure. From lifting legacy systems into the cloud to setting up production-grade CI/CD pipelines, I specialize in making deployments smoother and systems more reliable.

My tech stack includes Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS, Azure, GCP, and Python â€” tools I use daily to build scalable and secure infrastructure. I'm also a strong advocate of open-source and often incorporate community-driven tools into client solutions. When possible, I contribute back, because I believe open knowledge is the backbone of real innovation.

Beyond just setting things up, I focus on teaching teams how to own their infra â€” empowering them with automation, observability, and resilience patterns. Whether itâ€™s implementing GitOps, designing microservice-ready environments, or configuring multi-cloud strategies, I bring hands-on clarity to complex DevOps challenges.
